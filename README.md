# CareConnect
Created for DeerHacks 2023

## Inspiration
As children of immigrants, we have seen how the elderly in our respective communities struggle to communicate and find suitable PSWs that can provide the care that they need in their homes. 
Currently, finding a personal support worker in Canada is not as easy as it should be. Connecting PSWs with patients based on different criteria ensures better satisfaction for both PSWs and patients. Ultimately, we want to eliminate barriers so that all Canadians can get the full care that they are comfortable with.

## What it does
We thought of creating this web app to match patients based on various attributes, including language, patient needs, and location. The app matches PSWs with patients who may communicate better and provide better care, as well as ensuring that PSWs don't need to travel great distances.

## How we built it
We built this web app using React, HTML, and CSS for the front-end, and JavaScript processing for the back-end. This was built entirely on Repl.it, allowing for easy team collaboration and debugging.

## Challenges we ran into
We encountered some challenges with the form functionality of the web app, including obtaining and processing the data using ```states```. With some help from a mentor, we were able to process form data in the back-end according to the app requirements.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
We created a full-stack website using React.

## What we learned
We learned many React functions, states, and its use in the processing of data.

## What's next for CareConnect
For scalability, we could implement a database to store user data and PSW data.
Further, we can also implement the entire process dynamically from the perspectives of the PSWs, allowing a similar user experience for them.
